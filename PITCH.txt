# KarUCU Main Campus Digital Platform Proposal

## Executive Summary
We are proposing a comprehensive, role-based digital ecosystem for Karatina University Christian Union (KarUCU). This platform goes beyond a standard website by creating distinct, tailored experiences for every type of user—from the casual visitor to the core leadership team. It is designed to streamline ministry operations, deepen member engagement, and ensure secure, efficient administration.

The system uses a strict security model to ensure data integrity:
*   **Public**: Read-only access to general info.
*   **Member**: Read/Write access to *own* data (profile, journal).

*   **Data Integrity**: Built on **MySQL** with strict relationships to prevent data loss or corruption.
*   **Scalability**: The **Next.js** architecture allows the platform to grow from hundreds to thousands of users without performance degradation.

## Conclusion
This platform is a digital extension of the KarUCU physical ministry. By empowering editors to handle content and giving members tools for their personal walk, we free up the core leadership (Admins) to focus on vision and oversight rather than daily website maintenance.
